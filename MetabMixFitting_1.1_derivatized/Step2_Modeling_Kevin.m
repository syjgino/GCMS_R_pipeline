cutoff=50;   %this is the minimum AUC that will be used for fitting the data.  Any points for which AUC < cutoff will not contribute to the cost function or the fitting.
               % and if you want different cutoff for different fatty acid, set cutoff=[50,100,200], which means 50 for the 1st FA, 100 for the 2nd, 200 for the rest              
%%% usually not changed
q=0.011;    % the natural occuring 13C percentage, =0 the script will calclute q from control, if set =0.112, then this is the value that will be used in the fitting
lambda=0.023; % percentage of fragmentation for cholesterol data. nonsenese for fatty acid. if lambda=0, scripts will either calculate from unlabel controls or use default=0.023
user_p=[0,1];  % this is the user handle for range of percentage contribution of glucose
