20180326 Dylan added D_1_restriction handle; so that Model 3 restrict D_1 according to D_0 and D_2.
	this is for Joe to compare with ISA-elongation-once model
	most changes are made to [NewModel_MLEFIT.m]
	to enable this restriction, I passed ENRICH all the way to [NewModel_MLEFIT.m]
20170828 Dylan: added saving figure function for elongation=2. here on the figure it still says Model 1.5 , but it's actually model 3.5
20170814 Dylan: 
[1]. allow users to set ENRICH (this is the enrichment of C13 in C13 tracer). 
	I'm doing this because ENRICH changed from 0.984 to 0.99 even 1.00 in our C13 Glucose datasheet. 
	And Joe wants to be accurate
for cholesterol
comments:
changing ENRICH from 0.984 to 0.99. I tested Wayne's BMM_TLR data set for chol. 
for those p>10%
the change of modeled p is smaller than the sample standard deviation

[2]. Allow users to run Model 3 without running Model 1. reason: for Joe's VLC FAs, it takes a long time to Run model 1 when there is little synthesis. just to save time. This change involves multiple file updates. Now, 
elongation=2; % elongation=0 only runs model 1, 
               % elongation=1 runs both model 1 & 3, 
                     % use the likelihood from Model 1 as a termination criteira for model 3 iterations.
                     %and plot Model 1 and 3 results together
               % elongation=2 runs only Model 3, if there's no user setup p_s_e, it will set initial p =[.425,.025,.55],
                    %and randomize e and s
                    % since no likihood from Model1 is available, I set it to -1.

2016.6.14 Dylan: according to Joe, the Model 3 result will not tolerate any value that has worse fit than Model 1.
      

2016.2.26 Dylan add P_source, fix p0,p1,p2 for Joseph Argus

-------------problem remaining-----
[] skip those > 10min?
[] chol(not FA) sensitive to q and lambda, how should we decide good q and lambda, while likelihood doesn't tell much?
[] some chol p>0.5 is still fixable, because s is not extremely low. 


-------------fixed-----------------
2015.10.1 when chol s is extremely low, p can't be calculated accurately, sometimes the p will go up to the boundary. we set p=NaN  for this scenario
2015.6.26 temp file storage and better interface:
	you can look at calculation live, and they will be saved in a temp.mat file
	if script crashes, we can keep track
2015.6.27 q and lambda calculation from control:
	priority: user value > compute from control samples > default value
	[q=0.011, lambda=0.023]
	also fixed some formatting problem
